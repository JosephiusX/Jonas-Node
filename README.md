        25. An overview of how the web works

            Request-response model or Client-server architecture:
                client - Sends request to server and recieves response

                Server - recieves a request from Client and responds

            The domain is not the real address, a DNS will convert it to the ip address

            TCP/IP socket connection - communication protocol defines how data travels acrost the web, it breaks up the requests and responses into little chuncks called packets before they are sent, then when they reach the destination they are reassembled as quick as possible. 

            trying to send it as one big piece is like going through heavy traffic in a bus 

            HTTP REQUEST - also communication protocol

                start line- HTTP method + request target + HTTP version

                HTTP request headers(many diffrent possibilities)

                Request body (only when sending data to server, e.g. POST)
                

            Http RESPONSE - " "

                start line: HTTP version + status code + status message

                HTTP response headers (many diffrent possibilities)

                Response Body (most responses)
